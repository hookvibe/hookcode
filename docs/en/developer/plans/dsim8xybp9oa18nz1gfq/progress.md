# Progress Log
{/* WHAT: Your session log - a chronological record of what you did, when, and what happened. WHY: Answers "What have I done?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test. Helps you resume after breaks. WHEN: Update after completing each phase or encountering errors. More detailed than task_plan.md. */}

{/* Keep phase status updates in sync with task_plan.md for this session. dsim8xybp9oa18nz1gfq */}

## Session Metadata
- **Session Title:** Migrate docs.json to Docusaurus
- **Session Hash:** dsim8xybp9oa18nz1gfq

## Session: 2026-01-22
{/* WHAT: The date of this work session. WHY: Helps track when work happened, useful for resuming after time gaps. EXAMPLE: 2026-01-15 */}

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of actions taken during this phase. WHY: Provides context for what was done, making it easier to resume or debug. WHEN: Update as you work through the phase, or at least when you complete it. */}
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-01-22 14:00
{/* STATUS: Same as task_plan.md (pending, in_progress, complete) TIMESTAMP: When you started this phase (e.g., "2026-01-15 10:00") */}
- Actions taken:
  {/* WHAT: List of specific actions you performed. EXAMPLE: - Created todo.py with basic structure - Implemented add functionality - Fixed FileNotFoundError */}
  - Audited the existing docs setup (`docs/docs.json` Mintlify config) and the docs tree under `docs/en/**`.
  - Located the code paths that assume Mintlify (`package.json#dev:doc`) and planning scripts that sync `docs.json`.
- Files created/modified:
  {/* WHAT: Which files you created or changed. WHY: Quick reference for what was touched. Helps with debugging and review. EXAMPLE: - todo.py (created) - todos.json (created by app) - task_plan.md (updated) */}
  - `docs/en/developer/plans/dsim8xybp9oa18nz1gfq/task_plan.md`
  - `docs/en/developer/plans/dsim8xybp9oa18nz1gfq/findings.md`

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
{/* WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase. WHY: Keep a separate log entry for each phase to track progress clearly. */}
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Decided to host the Docusaurus site inside `docs/` as a workspace package and keep docs content in `docs/en/**`.
  - Mapped the existing Mintlify navigation structure into a Docusaurus sidebar (`docs/sidebars.ts`), with plan sessions autogenerated from `developer/plans/**`.
  - Updated planning-with-files scripts to skip `docs.json` sync when `docs/docs.json` is not present.
- Files created/modified:
  - `docs/docusaurus.config.ts`
  - `docs/sidebars.ts`
  - `docs/package.json`
  - `docs/AGENTS.md`
  - `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/scripts/init-session.sh`
  - `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/scripts/sync-docs-json-plans.sh`
  - `.codex/skills/planning-with-files/SKILL.md`

### Phase 3: Implementation
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Added a minimal Docusaurus site (config, sidebars, homepage, theme overrides).
  - Moved the docs logo to Docusaurus static assets and updated internal doc links to be Docusaurus-friendly.
  - Removed `docs/docs.json` and updated repo scripts to run Docusaurus instead of Mintlify.
- Files created/modified:
  - `docs/static/assets/logo.svg`
  - `docs/src/pages/index.tsx`
  - `docs/src/pages/index.module.css`
  - `docs/src/css/custom.css`
  - `docs/en/user-docs/index.md`
  - `docs/docs.json` (deleted)
  - `package.json` (workspace/scripts)
  - `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
  - `.gitignore`

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Installed workspace dependencies via `pnpm install`.
  - Built the docs site via `pnpm --filter hookcode-docs build`.
  - Added missing TS deps and config so `pnpm --filter hookcode-docs typecheck` passes.
- Files created/modified:
  - `docs/tsconfig.json`
  - `docs/src/css.d.ts`
  - `docs/package.json`
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml`

### Phase 5: Delivery
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Updated Unreleased changelog entry with this session hash.
- Files created/modified:
  - `docs/en/change-log/0.0.0.md`

## Test Results
{/* WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened. WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions. WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification). EXAMPLE: | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ | | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ | */}
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Docusaurus build | `pnpm --filter hookcode-docs build` | Build succeeds | Build succeeds | ✓ |
| Docs TS typecheck | `pnpm --filter hookcode-docs typecheck` | Typecheck passes | Typecheck passes | ✓ |

## Error Log
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts. WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes. WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly. EXAMPLE: | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check | | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling | */}
{/* Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition */}
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
| 2026-01-22 14:56 | `tsc --noEmit` failed (missing `@types/node`, Docusaurus module aliases) | 1 | Added missing devDependencies and updated `docs/tsconfig.json` to use Docusaurus tsconfig + module-type-aliases. |
| 2026-01-22 14:58 | `tsc --noEmit` failed (`@docusaurus/theme-classic` types not found) | 2 | Added `@docusaurus/theme-classic` to `docs/package.json` devDependencies. |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
{/* WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track. WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively. WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset. THE 5 QUESTIONS: 1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md 2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases 3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md 4. What have I learned? → See findings.md 5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file) */}
{/* If you can answer these, context is solid */}
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 5 (Delivery) |
| Where am I going? | Finish delivery message and keep docs runnable via `pnpm dev:doc`. |
| What's the goal? | Replace Mintlify `docs/docs.json` with a working Docusaurus docs site. |
| What have I learned? | `docs.json` sync is Mintlify-specific; Docusaurus navigation is handled by `sidebars.ts`. |
| What have I done? | Added a Docusaurus site under `docs/`, removed `docs/docs.json`, updated scripts, and validated build/typecheck. |

{/* REMINDER: - Update after completing each phase or encountering errors - Be detailed - this is your "what happened" log - Include timestamps for errors to track when issues occurred */}
