## Test Results
{/* WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened. WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions. WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification). EXAMPLE: | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ | | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ | */}
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Frontend AppShell tests | pnpm --filter hookcode-frontend test -- appShell.test.tsx | Pass | Pass | ✓ |

## Error Log
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts. WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes. WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly. EXAMPLE: | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check | | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling | */}
{/* Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition */}
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
|           |       | 1       |            |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
{/* WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track. WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively. WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset. THE 5 QUESTIONS: 1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md 2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases 3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md 4. What have I learned? → See findings.md 5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file) */}
{/* If you can answer these, context is solid */}
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase X |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | [goal statement] |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | See above |

{/* REMINDER: - Update after completing each phase or encountering errors - Be detailed - this is your "what happened" log - Include timestamps for errors to track when issues occurred */}
*Update after completing each phase or encountering errors*
