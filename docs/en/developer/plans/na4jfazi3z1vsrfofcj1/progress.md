# Progress Log
{/* WHAT: Your session log - a chronological record of what you did, when, and what happened. WHY: Answers "What have I done?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test. Helps you resume after breaks. WHEN: Update after completing each phase or encountering errors. More detailed than task_plan.md. */}

{/* Keep phase status updates in sync with task_plan.md for this session. na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1 */}

## Session Metadata
- **Session Title:** Fix SSE stream 404 (Vite /api proxy)
- **Session Hash:** na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1

## Session: 2026-01-17
{/* WHAT: The date of this work session. WHY: Helps track when work happened, useful for resuming after time gaps. EXAMPLE: 2026-01-15 */}

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of actions taken during this phase. WHY: Provides context for what was done, making it easier to resume or debug. WHEN: Update as you work through the phase, or at least when you complete it. */}
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-01-17 16:41
{/* STATUS: Same as task_plan.md (pending, in_progress, complete) TIMESTAMP: When you started this phase (e.g., "2026-01-15 10:00") */}
- Actions taken:
  {/* WHAT: List of specific actions you performed. EXAMPLE: - Created todo.py with basic structure - Implemented add functionality - Fixed FileNotFoundError */}
  - Located frontend SSE URL builder (`frontend/src/utils/apiUrl.ts`) and confirmed it defaults to `/api`.
  - Confirmed backend SSE endpoint exists at `GET /api/events/stream` (`backend/src/modules/events/events.controller.ts`).
  - Verified Vite dev server proxies `/api/*` (`frontend/vite.config.ts`), but the default target uses `http://localhost:4000` and does not consider `HOOKCODE_BACKEND_PORT` (possible mismatch causing the 404).
- Files created/modified:
  {/* WHAT: Which files you created or changed. WHY: Quick reference for what was touched. Helps with debugging and review. EXAMPLE: - todo.py (created) - todos.json (created by app) - task_plan.md (updated) */}
  - docs/en/developer/plans/na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1/task_plan.md (updated)
  - docs/en/developer/plans/na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1/findings.md (updated)
  - docs/en/developer/plans/na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1/progress.md (updated)

### Phase 2: [Title]
{/* WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase. WHY: Keep a separate log entry for each phase to track progress clearly. */}
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Updated Vite `/api` proxy target resolution to prefer `127.0.0.1` and support `HOOKCODE_BACKEND_PORT`.
  - Updated `frontend/.env.example` to document `HOOKCODE_BACKEND_PORT` and prefer `127.0.0.1` in examples.
- Files created/modified:
  - frontend/vite.config.ts (updated)
  - frontend/.env.example (updated)
  - docs/en/change-log/0.0.0.md (updated)

## Test Results
{/* WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened. WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions. WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification). EXAMPLE: | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ | | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ | */}
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Frontend unit tests | `pnpm --filter hookcode-frontend test` | All tests pass | 43 passed (11 files) | ✓ |

## Error Log
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts. WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes. WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly. EXAMPLE: | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check | | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling | */}
{/* Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition */}
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
|           |       | 1       |            |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
{/* WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track. WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively. WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset. THE 5 QUESTIONS: 1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md 2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases 3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md 4. What have I learned? → See findings.md 5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file) */}
{/* If you can answer these, context is solid */}
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase X |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | [goal statement] |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | See above |

{/* REMINDER: - Update after completing each phase or encountering errors - Be detailed - this is your "what happened" log - Include timestamps for errors to track when issues occurred */}
*Update after completing each phase or encountering errors*
