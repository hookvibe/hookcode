# Findings & Decisions: SSE stream 404 (Vite /api)
<!-- Capture discovery about Vite /api routing vs backend SSE endpoints. na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1 -->
<!-- 
  WHAT: Your knowledge base for the task. Stores everything you discover and decide.
  WHY: Context windows are limited. This file is your "external memory" - persistent and unlimited.
  WHEN: Update after ANY discovery, especially after 2 view/browser/search operations (2-Action Rule).
-->

<!-- Link discoveries to code changes via this session hash. na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1 -->

## Session Metadata
- **Session Hash:** na4jfazi3z1vsrfofcj1
- **Created:** 2026-01-17

## Requirements
<!-- 
  WHAT: What the user asked for, broken down into specific requirements.
  WHY: Keeps requirements visible so you don't forget what you're building.
  WHEN: Fill this in during Phase 1 (Requirements & Discovery).
  EXAMPLE:
    - Command-line interface
    - Add tasks
    - List all tasks
    - Delete tasks
    - Python implementation
-->
<!-- Captured from user request -->
- Fix `GET http://localhost:5173/api/events/stream?topics=dashboard&token=...` returning `404 Not Found` in local dev.
- Ensure dashboard/topic SSE stream works reliably in local dev.

## Research Findings
<!-- 
  WHAT: Key discoveries from web searches, documentation reading, or exploration.
  WHY: Multimodal content (images, browser results) doesn't persist. Write it down immediately.
  WHEN: After EVERY 2 view/browser/search operations, update this section (2-Action Rule).
  EXAMPLE:
    - Python's argparse module supports subcommands for clean CLI design
    - JSON module handles file persistence easily
    - Standard pattern: python script.py <command> [args]
-->
<!-- Key discoveries during exploration -->
- Backend SSE endpoint exists: `GET /api/events/stream` (Nest controller `backend/src/modules/events/events.controller.ts`).
- Frontend constructs SSE URL via `buildApiUrl()` defaulting to `/api`, so the browser hits the Vite dev server origin (5173) when no explicit base URL is applied.
- Vite dev config already proxies `/api/*` (`frontend/vite.config.ts`), but the default target uses `http://localhost:4000` and does not consider `HOOKCODE_BACKEND_PORT`, which can break routing (e.g., IPv6 `localhost -> ::1` or non-4000 backend port).

## Technical Decisions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Architecture and implementation choices you've made, with reasoning.
  WHY: You'll forget why you chose a technology or approach. This table preserves that knowledge.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant technical choice.
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
    | argparse with subcommands | Clean CLI: python todo.py add "task" |
-->
<!-- Decisions made with rationale -->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Improve Vite `/api` proxy target resolution (prefer 127.0.0.1 + support `HOOKCODE_BACKEND_PORT`) | Avoids `localhost` IPv6 pitfalls and keeps `/api/*` routing aligned with the actual backend port in local dev. |

## Issues Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Problems you ran into and how you solved them.
  WHY: Similar to errors in task_plan.md, but focused on broader issues (not just code errors).
  WHEN: Document when you encounter blockers or unexpected challenges.
  EXAMPLE:
    | Empty file causes JSONDecodeError | Added explicit empty file check before json.load() |
-->
<!-- Errors and how they were resolved -->
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
|       |            |

## Resources
<!-- 
  WHAT: URLs, file paths, API references, documentation links you've found useful.
  WHY: Easy reference for later. Don't lose important links in context.
  WHEN: Add as you discover useful resources.
  EXAMPLE:
    - Python argparse docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
    - Project structure: src/main.py, src/utils.py
-->
<!-- URLs, file paths, API references -->
-

## Visual/Browser Findings
<!-- 
  WHAT: Information you learned from viewing images, PDFs, or browser results.
  WHY: CRITICAL - Visual/multimodal content doesn't persist in context. Must be captured as text.
  WHEN: IMMEDIATELY after viewing images or browser results. Don't wait!
  EXAMPLE:
    - Screenshot shows login form has email and password fields
    - Browser shows API returns JSON with "status" and "data" keys
-->
<!-- CRITICAL: Update after every 2 view/browser operations -->
<!-- Multimodal content must be captured as text immediately -->

<!-- 
  REMINDER: The 2-Action Rule
  After every 2 view/browser/search operations, you MUST update this file.
  This prevents visual information from being lost when context resets.
