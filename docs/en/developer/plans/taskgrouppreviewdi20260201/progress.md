# Progress Log
{/* WHAT: Your session log - a chronological record of what you did, when, and what happened. WHY: Answers "What have I done?" in the 5-Question Reboot Test. Helps you resume after breaks. WHEN: Update after completing each phase or encountering errors. More detailed than task_plan.md. */}

{/* Keep phase status updates in sync for this DI fix. docs/en/developer/plans/taskgrouppreviewdi20260201/task_plan.md taskgrouppreviewdi20260201 */}

## Session Metadata
- **Session Title:** Fix TaskGroupPreviewController DI error
- **Session Hash:** taskgrouppreviewdi20260201

## Session: 2026-02-01
{/* WHAT: The date of this work session. WHY: Helps track when work happened, useful for resuming after time gaps. EXAMPLE: 2026-01-15 */}

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of actions taken during this phase. WHY: Provides context for what was done, making it easier to resume or debug. WHEN: Update as you work through the phase, or at least when you complete it. */}
- **Status:** complete
- **Started:** 2026-02-01 20:40
{/* STATUS: Same as task_plan.md (pending, in_progress, complete) TIMESTAMP: When you started this phase (e.g., "2026-01-15 10:00") */}
- Actions taken:
  {/* WHAT: List of specific actions you performed. EXAMPLE: - Created todo.py with basic structure - Implemented add functionality - Fixed FileNotFoundError */}
  - Reviewed the NestJS DI error and traced TaskGroupPreviewController dependencies.
  - Located TasksHttpModule, TasksModule, and PreviewHighlightService wiring.
- Files created/modified:
  {/* WHAT: Which files you created or changed. WHY: Quick reference for what was touched. Helps with debugging and review. EXAMPLE: - todo.py (created) - todos.json (created by app) - task_plan.md (updated) */}

  - docs/en/developer/plans/taskgrouppreviewdi20260201/findings.md

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
{/* WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase. WHY: Keep a separate log entry for each phase to track progress clearly. */}
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Chose to export PreviewHighlightService from TasksModule for TasksHttpModule controllers.
  - Captured decision rationale in the task plan.
- Files created/modified:
  - docs/en/developer/plans/taskgrouppreviewdi20260201/task_plan.md

### Phase 3: Implementation

  - Added PreviewHighlightService to TasksModule exports with traceability comment.
- Files created/modified:
  - backend/src/modules/tasks/tasks.module.ts

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
{/* WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase. WHY: Keep a separate log entry for each phase to track progress clearly. */}
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Documented that tests were not run for this small wiring change.
- Files created/modified:
  - docs/en/developer/plans/taskgrouppreviewdi20260201/progress.md

### Phase 5: Delivery
{/* WHAT: Same structure as Phase 1, for the next phase. WHY: Keep a separate log entry for each phase to track progress clearly. */}
- **Status:** complete
- Actions taken:
  - Added changelog entry for the DI fix.
- Files created/modified:
  - docs/en/change-log/0.0.0.md

## Test Results
{/* WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened. WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions. WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification). EXAMPLE: | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ | | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ | */}
| Test | Input | Expected | Actual | Status |
|------|-------|----------|--------|--------|
| Not run (not requested) | N/A | N/A | Not run | skipped |

## Error Log
{/* WHAT: Detailed log of every error encountered, with timestamps and resolution attempts. WHY: More detailed than task_plan.md's error table. Helps you learn from mistakes. WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly. EXAMPLE: | 2026-01-15 10:35 | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Added file existence check | | 2026-01-15 10:37 | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Added empty file handling | */}
{/* Keep ALL errors - they help avoid repetition */}
| Timestamp | Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-----------|-------|---------|------------|
|           |       | 1       |            |

## 5-Question Reboot Check
{/* WHAT: Five questions that verify your context is solid. If you can answer these, you're on track. WHY: This is the "reboot test" - if you can answer all 5, you can resume work effectively. WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset. THE 5 QUESTIONS: 1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md 2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases 3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md 4. What have I learned? → See findings.md 5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file) */}
{/* If you can answer these, context is solid */}
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase 4 (Testing & Verification) |
| Where am I going? | Phase 4 then Phase 5 (Delivery) |
| What's the goal? | Resolve TaskGroupPreviewController DI by exporting PreviewHighlightService for TasksHttpModule. |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | Logged discovery and exported PreviewHighlightService from TasksModule. |
