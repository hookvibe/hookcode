## Test Results
{/* WHAT: Table of tests you ran, what you expected, what actually happened. WHY: Documents verification of functionality. Helps catch regressions. WHEN: Update as you test features, especially during Phase 4 (Testing & Verification). EXAMPLE: | Add task | python todo.py add "Buy milk" | Task added | Task added successfully | ✓ | | List tasks | python todo.py list | Shows all tasks | Shows all tasks | ✓ | */}

WHEN: Update periodically, especially when resuming after a break or context reset. THE 5 QUESTIONS: 1. Where am I? → Current phase in task_plan.md 2. Where am I going? → Remaining phases 3. What's the goal? → Goal statement in task_plan.md 4. What have I learned? → See findings.md 5. What have I done? → See progress.md (this file) */}
{/* If you can answer these, context is solid */}
| Question | Answer |
|----------|--------|
| Where am I? | Phase X |
| Where am I going? | Remaining phases |
| What's the goal? | [goal statement] |
| What have I learned? | See findings.md |
| What have I done? | See above |
