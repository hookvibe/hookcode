# Task Plan: Queued Task Waiting Reason Hints and Retry
{/* Translate remaining Chinese content to English for docs/en consistency. docsentrans20260121 */}
{/* WHAT: This is your roadmap for the entire task. Think of it as your "working memory on disk." WHY: After 50+ tool calls, your original goals can get forgotten. This file keeps them fresh. WHEN: Create this FIRST, before starting any work. Update after each phase completes. */}

{/* Track code changes with this session hash for traceability. f3a9c2d8e1b7f4a0c6d1 */}

## Session Metadata
{/* WHAT: Stable identifiers for traceability (code comments ↔ plan folder). WHY: Makes it easy to find the plan that explains a change. */}
- **Session Hash:** f3a9c2d8e1b7f4a0c6d1
- **Created:** 2026-01-19

## Goal
{/* WHAT: One clear sentence describing what you're trying to achieve. WHY: This is your north star. Re-reading this keeps you focused on the end state. EXAMPLE: "Create a Python CLI todo app with add, list, and delete functionality." */}
{/* Clarify the user-visible end state for queued tasks and retry UX. f3a9c2d8e1b7f4a0c6d1 */}
In the task list and task detail views, show an explainable reason for "a task has stayed queued for a long time", and provide a safe retry button (including backend diagnosis + retry API and frontend UI/interaction).

## Current Phase
{/* WHAT: Which phase you're currently working on (e.g., "Phase 1", "Phase 3"). WHY: Quick reference for where you are in the task. Update this as you progress. */}
Complete

## Phases
{/* WHAT: Break your task into 3-7 logical phases. Each phase should be completable. WHY: Breaking work into phases prevents overwhelm and makes progress visible. WHEN: Update status after completing each phase: pending → in_progress → complete */}

### Phase 1: Requirements & Discovery
{/* WHAT: Understand what needs to be done and gather initial information. WHY: Starting without understanding leads to wasted effort. This phase prevents that. */}
- [x] Understand user intent
- [x] Identify constraints and requirements
- [x] Document findings in findings.md
- **Status:** complete
{/* STATUS VALUES: - pending: Not started yet - in_progress: Currently working on this - complete: Finished this phase */}

### Phase 2: Planning & Structure
{/* WHAT: Decide how you'll approach the problem and what structure you'll use. WHY: Good planning prevents rework. Document decisions so you remember why you chose them. */}
- [x] Define technical approach
- [x] Decide API shape for queue diagnosis
- [x] Decide UI placement for queue reason + retry
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 3: Implementation
{/* WHAT: Actually build/create/write the solution. WHY: This is where the work happens. Break into smaller sub-tasks if needed. */}
- [x] Execute the plan step by step
- [x] Implement backend queue diagnosis + types
- [x] Implement frontend queued hint + retry buttons
- [x] Test incrementally
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 4: Testing & Verification
{/* WHAT: Verify everything works and meets requirements. WHY: Catching issues early saves time. Document test results in progress.md. */}
- [x] Verify all requirements met
- [x] Document test results in progress.md
- [x] Fix any issues found
- **Status:** complete

### Phase 5: Delivery
{/* WHAT: Final review and handoff to user. WHY: Ensures nothing is forgotten and deliverables are complete. */}
- [x] Review all output files
- [x] Update changelog entry
- [x] Deliver to user
- **Status:** complete

## Key Questions
{/* WHAT: Important questions you need to answer during the task. WHY: These guide your research and decision-making. Answer them as you go. EXAMPLE: 1. Should tasks persist between sessions? (Yes - need file storage) 2. What format for storing tasks? (JSON file) */}
1. What does a task being "queued/waiting" mean on the backend (DB status / queue job status / worker lock)?
2. What are typical reasons a task stays queued for a long time, and which reasons can be reliably detected and returned to the frontend?
3. How should "retry" be defined: re-enqueue, re-execute, or create a new task linked to the old one (idempotency/audit)?
4. What should be the visibility/clickability conditions for the retry button (permissions, status, cooldown, max attempts)?
5. Where should the frontend show the reason and what should the copy format be (list, detail, tooltip, error code)?

## Decisions Made
{/* WHAT: Technical and design decisions you've made, with the reasoning behind them. WHY: You'll forget why you made choices. This table helps you remember and justify decisions. WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant choice (technology, approach, structure). EXAMPLE: | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support | */}
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Add structured queue diagnosis on Task API | Frontend can render clear queued-state hints without hardcoding backend internals. |
| Reuse existing `POST /tasks/:id/retry` for queued retry | Avoid new endpoints; keep behavior consistent with existing retry UI for failed/processing tasks. |

## Errors Encountered
{/* WHAT: Every error you encounter, what attempt number it was, and how you resolved it. WHY: Logging errors prevents repeating the same mistakes. This is critical for learning. WHEN: Add immediately when an error occurs, even if you fix it quickly. EXAMPLE: | FileNotFoundError | 1 | Check if file exists, create empty list if not | | JSONDecodeError | 2 | Handle empty file case explicitly | */}
| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes
{/* REMINDERS: - Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete - Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation) - Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition - Never repeat a failed action - mutate your approach instead */}
- Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
- Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
- Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
