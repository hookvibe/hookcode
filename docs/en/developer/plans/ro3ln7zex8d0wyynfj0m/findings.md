# Findings & Decisions: Replace loading spinners with skeletons
{/* Translate remaining Chinese content to English for docs/en consistency. docsentrans20260121 */}
{/* WHAT: Your knowledge base for the task. Stores everything you discover and decide. WHY: Context windows are limited. This file is your "external memory" - persistent and unlimited. WHEN: Update after ANY discovery, especially after 2 view/browser/search operations (2-Action Rule). */}

## Session Metadata
- **Session Hash:** ro3ln7zex8d0wyynfj0m
- **Created:** 2026-01-17

## Requirements
{/* WHAT: What the user asked for, broken down into specific requirements. WHY: Keeps requirements visible so you don't forget what you're building. WHEN: Fill this in during Phase 1 (Requirements & Discovery). EXAMPLE: - Command-line interface - Add tasks - List all tasks - Delete tasks - Python implementation */}
{/* Captured from user request */}
- Replace simple loading icons/placeholders in the current frontend UI with Skeleton (skeleton screens) for better perceived performance.
- Prefer skeletons for "content waiting" states (initial data fetch / empty while loading / detail fetch / modal detail fetch).
- Update `frontend/AGENTS.md` to enforce: waiting content must use skeleton loading UI.
- Keep existing i18n and theme (light/dark + accent) compatibility.

## Research Findings
{/* WHAT: Key discoveries from web searches, documentation reading, or exploration. WHY: Multimodal content (images, browser results) doesn't persist. Write it down immediately. WHEN: After EVERY 2 view/browser/search operations, update this section (2-Action Rule). EXAMPLE: - Python's argparse module supports subcommands for clean CLI design - JSON module handles file persistence easily - Standard pattern: python script.py <command> [args] */}
{/* Key discoveries during exploration */}
- Frontend is React + Vite and uses Ant Design v6 (`antd@^6.1.4`), which provides `Skeleton`.
- Multiple pages currently render `<Empty description={t('common.loading')} />` when loading (e.g. TasksPage, ReposPage, RepoDetailPage, TaskDetailPage, TaskGroupChatPage).
- Some panels/tables rely on AntD `Table`/`Spin` loading via `loading={...}` props (e.g. Repo webhook deliveries table).
- Chat/task detail pages show plain text `t('common.loading')` while waiting for `/auth/me` feature toggles (logs enabled state).

## Technical Decisions
{/* WHAT: Architecture and implementation choices you've made, with reasoning. WHY: You'll forget why you chose a technology or approach. This table preserves that knowledge. WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant technical choice. EXAMPLE: | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support | | argparse with subcommands | Clean CLI: python todo.py add "task" | */}
{/* Decisions made with rationale */}
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Use AntD `Skeleton` components for loading UIs | No new deps; fits existing AntD visual system and themes |
| Add reusable skeleton components under `frontend/src/components/skeletons/*` | Avoid duplicated skeleton markup and make future additions consistent |
| Add `aria-busy` + `data-testid` on skeleton containers | Enables a11y semantics and stable UI tests for loading states |
| Keep button `loading` spinners for user actions | Skeleton is for missing content; spinners are appropriate for discrete mutations |

## Issues Encountered
{/* WHAT: Problems you ran into and how you solved them. WHY: Similar to errors in task_plan.md, but focused on broader issues (not just code errors). WHEN: Document when you encounter blockers or unexpected challenges. EXAMPLE: | Empty file causes JSONDecodeError | Added explicit empty file check before json.load() | */}
{/* Errors and how they were resolved */}
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
|       |            |

## Resources
{/* WHAT: URLs, file paths, API references, documentation links you've found useful. WHY: Easy reference for later. Don't lose important links in context. WHEN: Add as you discover useful resources. EXAMPLE: - Python argparse docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html - Project structure: src/main.py, src/utils.py */}
{/* URLs, file paths, API references */}
- `frontend/src/pages/TasksPage.tsx` (loading Empty placeholder)
- `frontend/src/pages/ReposPage.tsx` (loading Empty placeholder)
- `frontend/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx` (loading Empty placeholder + logs gating loading text)
- `frontend/src/pages/TaskGroupChatPage.tsx` (group loading Empty placeholder)
- `frontend/src/components/chat/TaskConversationItem.tsx` (logs gating loading text)
- `frontend/src/components/repos/RepoWebhookDeliveriesPanel.tsx` (table loading + detail loading text)

## Visual/Browser Findings
{/* WHAT: Information you learned from viewing images, PDFs, or browser results. WHY: CRITICAL - Visual/multimodal content doesn't persist in context. Must be captured as text. WHEN: IMMEDIATELY after viewing images or browser results. Don't wait! EXAMPLE: - Screenshot shows login form has email and password fields - Browser shows API returns JSON with "status" and "data" keys */}
{/* CRITICAL: Update after every 2 view/browser operations */}
{/* Multimodal content must be captured as text immediately */}
