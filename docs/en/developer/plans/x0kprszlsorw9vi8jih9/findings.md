# Findings & Decisions: 任务详情 Prompt patch 双栏展示
<!-- 
  WHAT: Your knowledge base for the task. Stores everything you discover and decide.
  WHY: Context windows are limited. This file is your "external memory" - persistent and unlimited.
  WHEN: Update after ANY discovery, especially after 2 view/browser/search operations (2-Action Rule).
-->

<!-- Link discoveries to code changes via this session hash. x0kprszlsorw9vi8jih9 -->

## Session Metadata
- **Session Hash:** x0kprszlsorw9vi8jih9
- **Created:** 2026-01-19

## Requirements
<!-- 
  WHAT: What the user asked for, broken down into specific requirements.
  WHY: Keeps requirements visible so you don't forget what you're building.
  WHEN: Fill this in during Phase 1 (Requirements & Discovery).
  EXAMPLE:
    - Command-line interface
    - Add tasks
    - List all tasks
    - Delete tasks
    - Python implementation
-->
<!-- Captured from user request -->
- 任务详情页的 Prompt patch（提示词片段）展示需要分成两栏：左侧原始模板，右侧渲染后的内容（变量已替换）。
- 渲染后内容需尽量与后端 promptBuilder 的变量语义一致，至少覆盖 `{{issue.number}}` 等常用变量。

## Research Findings
<!-- 
  WHAT: Key discoveries from web searches, documentation reading, or exploration.
  WHY: Multimodal content (images, browser results) doesn't persist. Write it down immediately.
  WHEN: After EVERY 2 view/browser/search operations, update this section (2-Action Rule).
  EXAMPLE:
    - Python's argparse module supports subcommands for clean CLI design
    - JSON module handles file persistence easily
    - Standard pattern: python script.py <command> [args]
-->
<!-- Key discoveries during exploration -->
- 当前 Prompt patch 展示位于 `frontend/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx`，直接渲染 `task.promptCustom`（未做模板变量替换）。
- 后端模板语法为 `{{path.to.value}}`，缺失值渲染为空字符串（参考 `backend/src/agent/template.ts`）。

## Technical Decisions
<!-- 
  WHAT: Architecture and implementation choices you've made, with reasoning.
  WHY: You'll forget why you chose a technology or approach. This table preserves that knowledge.
  WHEN: Update whenever you make a significant technical choice.
  EXAMPLE:
    | Use JSON for storage | Simple, human-readable, built-in Python support |
    | argparse with subcommands | Clean CLI: python todo.py add "task" |
-->
<!-- Decisions made with rationale -->
| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| 在前端实现与后端一致的轻量 `renderTemplate()` 并构造 best-effort 上下文 | 变更面小、无需新增后端接口/存储；能即时展示“渲染后”效果并支持历史任务。 |

## Issues Encountered
<!-- 
  WHAT: Problems you ran into and how you solved them.
  WHY: Similar to errors in task_plan.md, but focused on broader issues (not just code errors).
  WHEN: Document when you encounter blockers or unexpected challenges.
  EXAMPLE:
    | Empty file causes JSONDecodeError | Added explicit empty file check before json.load() |
-->
<!-- Errors and how they were resolved -->
| Issue | Resolution |
|-------|------------|
|       |            |

## Resources
<!-- 
  WHAT: URLs, file paths, API references, documentation links you've found useful.
  WHY: Easy reference for later. Don't lose important links in context.
  WHEN: Add as you discover useful resources.
  EXAMPLE:
    - Python argparse docs: https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html
    - Project structure: src/main.py, src/utils.py
-->
<!-- URLs, file paths, API references -->
- `frontend/src/pages/TaskDetailPage.tsx`（Prompt patch 展示位置）
- `backend/src/agent/template.ts`（模板变量替换规则）

## Visual/Browser Findings
<!-- 
  WHAT: Information you learned from viewing images, PDFs, or browser results.
  WHY: CRITICAL - Visual/multimodal content doesn't persist in context. Must be captured as text.
  WHEN: IMMEDIATELY after viewing images or browser results. Don't wait!
  EXAMPLE:
    - Screenshot shows login form has email and password fields
    - Browser shows API returns JSON with "status" and "data" keys
-->
<!-- CRITICAL: Update after every 2 view/browser operations -->
<!-- Multimodal content must be captured as text immediately -->

<!-- 
  REMINDER: The 2-Action Rule
  After every 2 view/browser/search operations, you MUST update this file.
  This prevents visual information from being lost when context resets.

*Update this file after every 2 view/browser/search operations*
