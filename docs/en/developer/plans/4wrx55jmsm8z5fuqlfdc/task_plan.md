## Key Questions

1. Should the task-group compact UI jump directly (single group) vs. show a chooser (multiple groups)?
2. Should the refresh button refresh all columns at once, while pagination only refreshes one column?

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
|          |           |

## Errors Encountered

| Error | Attempt | Resolution |
|-------|---------|------------|
|       | 1       |            |

## Notes

- Update phase status as you progress: pending → in_progress → complete
- Re-read this plan before major decisions (attention manipulation)
- Log ALL errors - they help avoid repetition
